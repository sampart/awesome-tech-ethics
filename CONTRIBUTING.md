# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! If you've got a resource you'd like to include, read on to see what this list is and isn't about.

## What's meant by "tech ethics resources"?

In the context of this list, "tech ethics" means "mitigating and avoiding the potential negative effects of technology on society". By "resources", I mean that the focus of the list is primarily on things that can help those involved in technological development achieve this mitigation/avoidance, as opposed to items that are solely about critique.

## What's not included here?

There are lots of excellent areas that are related to tech ethics but are deliberately not covered here. This exclusion is because these areas are big enough to warrant their own individual lists, or because their focus is different to the one defined above (or both), not because I don't think they're awesome topics!

Where I know of an Awesome List or similar for that area, I've included it in the "See also" section.

- Environmental sustainability
- Tech accessibility
- Diversity in tech
- Unionization and Organization in tech
- Tech for Good
